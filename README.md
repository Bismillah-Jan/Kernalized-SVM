# The Stuffs demonstrates the Kernalized SVM
* The Kernalized SVM is implemented from scrath.
* Two kernels Polynomial and RBF are implemented from scratch
* Note: Please Note that the alpha are selected as weights (Just as an example).

## Sample outputs is given below for XOR problem

- For Polynomial of degree 2 (Quadratic Kernel) the output is:
