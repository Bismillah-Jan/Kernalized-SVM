# This work demonstrates the Kernalized SVM
* The Kernalized SVM is implemented from scratch.
* Two kernels, the Polynomial and the RBF, are also implemented from scratch
* Mind, the alpha are selected as weights (Just as an example).
## How to Run the program
 - Download the python files in a directory and run only the "runner.py"

## Sample outputs is given below for XOR problem

- For Polynomial of degree 2 (Quadratic Kernel) the output is:
